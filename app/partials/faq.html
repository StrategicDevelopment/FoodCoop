    <accordion-group heading="How do I join?">
    <p>You can sign up as a Producer or Customer member <a href="/signup">here</a>. Both customers and producers can shop but only an approved producer can sell. If you sign up with Facebook, you will not need a password on your account but we would appreciate you providing your phone number and address anyways. Your address is required for registering you as a shareholder (so you can earn dividends and vote).</p>

    <p>Please note that if you want to become a Producer Member, you will need to fill out a producer application form, which will be reviewed before your producer status is granted. You may shop in the store as normal while awaiting the approval of your application. Approval usually takes less than 24 hours.</p>

    <accordion-group heading="Where do I collect my orders?" ng-click="hashFunction('delivery-day')" is-open="hash === 'delivery-day'">
      <p>Member's orders are collected and sorted each Tuesday.</p>
      
      <p>If you live in Whangarei, or want to collect your food while you’re in town, you can pick up your order from The Woods (1 Woods Road), in central Whangarei. We are behind Chipmunks. Orders are avaible for collection from 3:00 p.m. onwards on Tuesday. Feel free to call ahead if you need to make other arrangements. Shipping is available for an extra charge.</p>

      <p>If Whangarei is too far for you to travel, you can pick up your goods from a collection point closer to home. If you join a  <a href="/delivery">delivery route</a> you can pick up from a fellow co-op member closer to home. Your local Route Manager fascilitates these pickups. Contact details for our Route Managers in communities all over Northland can be found <a href="/delivery">here.</a></p>
      <p>If there is no delivery route to your area, please feel free to shop anyway and the co-op can arrange your delivery with you.</p>

	<accordion-group heading="Why does being a producer cost more?" ng-click="hashFunction('test')" is-open="hash === 'test'">

		<p>Becoming a Producer Member allows you to use our website to sell your products. The slightly higher cost allows us to continue maintaining the website for you, and pays for reveiwing and approving Producer applications.</p>

		<p>Most producers recoup the cost of membership quickly by selling their products through the NNFC. However, should a producer wish to leave the co-op, the membership fee is completely refundable.</p>
	</accordion-group>
	
	<accordion-group heading="How do I upload my products?" ng-click="hashFunction('upload-products')" is-open="hash === 'upload-products'">
		<p>You can upload products any time. Simply submit the online product upload form found <a href="/product-upload">here.</a></p>
		<p>Once a product is uploaded it will stay in the store until you hide it. You can quickly hide a product from the Sales Dashboard or when editing a product. Once hidden, you can re-publish a product from the product edit screen.</p> 
		<p>Should you need to make changes to your products, simply select it in the store or from your sales dashboard and you can make any changes you need. Save your product with those new changes for them to instantly take effect. Please note that changing a product will not modify a product in someone's shopping cart or a record of your product in someone's past order.</p>

	<accordion-group heading="What kind of food can I sell?">
		<p>In most cases, if you grew it, made it, or raised it in Northland, you can sell it. However, there are a few exceptions. </p>

    <p>We are proud to be GE free. Genetically engineered products will not be accepted for sale. This extends to goods that have GE ingredients, and animal products where the animal was fed genetically engineered material. If you'd like to transition your operation away from GE inputs, please contact us and we can give you free consulting. As a Natural Food Co-op, we also require that producers declare all chemicals used in their production process. You can still sell your goods through the NNFC, but all chemical agents must be declared.</p>

    <p>Finally, for the sake of the animals, we do not accept goods derived from Confined Animal Feeding Operations (such as battery hens). Free range meat, milk and eggs only.</p>

	<accordion-group heading="When can I shop?" ng-click="hashFunction('shopping-start')" is-open="hash === 'shopping-start'">
		<p>You can shop any time: morning, evening or night. However, any items you add to your cart on a Friday will not be processed until a week from Tuesday. Our producers need time to gather and prepare your orders so they can be as fresh as possible. To achieve this we cut off orders for Tuesday's delivery day the previous Friday.</p>
	</accordion-group>
	<accordion-group heading="After shopping, how long do I have to pay?" ng-click="hashFunction('how-long-to-pay')" is-open="hash === 'how-long-to-pay'">
		<p>Check the <a href="/calendar">calendar</a> on our website to find out when you must have paid your shopping invoice to us. Ideally we like to have received payment before delivery day so we can pay the producers after they've delivered member's orders.</p>
		<p>
	</accordion-group>
	
	<accordion-group heading="Where do I take the products I’ve sold?">

    <p>Producers should bring the goods their customers have ordered to The Woods, our sorting facility in Central Whangarei.</p>

    <p>All goods need to be dropped off at The Woods by 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
    <h2>Don't want to deliver?</h2>
    <p>If your goods have a stable shelf life, we can stock them for you. We have refrigeration and freezer space available as well. Goods stocked this way are generally sold on commission or by negotiation with the administrator.
