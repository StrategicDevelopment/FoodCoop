	<h2>The NNFC's job is to support and strengthen local food economies</h2>

	<p class="lead">The Northland Natural Food Co-op (NNFC) is a marketing network of Northland farmers, growers, producers and customers. The NNFC’s activities are governed by the core values of healthy rural communities, environmental stewardship, social justice and vibrant local economies.</p>

		<h2>What is a food co-op?</h2>
		<p>By definition, a co-op is owned by its members.  Members of the Northland Natural Food Co-op, will be participating in the creation of a local not-for-profit food system in Northland. The Northland NFC is based on existing working models around the world. See the <a href="http://www.oklahomafood.coop/">Oklahoma Food Co-op</a> and <a href="http://www.ottawavalleyfood.org/">Ottawa Valley Food Co-op for examples</a>.</p>

	<h2>How does the Co-op Work? (Under Development)</h2>

	<p>Each month, our producer members post what they have available on our website (still in development). Members have one week to place orders.</p>

	<p>Then once a month, member producers bring the orders to central Whangarei (exact location still not decided) where the co-op’s volunteers sort everything into customer orders. The orders then go out to several pick-up sites in towns and rural areas across Northland. The Co-op pays for the deliverer’s petrol.</p>

	<p>We are looking to schedule a public meeting to discuss logistics of collecting, sorting and delivering goods to members.</p>
