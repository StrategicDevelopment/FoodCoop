	<p class="lead">This web app is a <strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong> so many features are <a href="https://github.com/StrategicDevelopment/FoodCoop/#foodcoop"> complete</a> but some are still <a href="https://github.com/StrategicDevelopment/FoodCoop/#foodcoop"> missing.</a></p>

		<h2>What is a food co-op?</h2>
		<p>By definition, a co-op is owned by its members.  Members of the Northland Natural Food Co-op, will be participating in the creation of a local not-for-profit food system in Northland. The Northland NFC is based on existing working models around the world. See the <a href="http://www.oklahomafood.coop/">Oklahoma Food Co-op</a> and <a href="http://www.ottawavalleyfood.org/">Ottawa Valley Food Co-op for examples</a>.</p>

	<h2>How does the Co-op Work? (Under Development)</h2>

	<p>Each month, our producer members post what they have available on our website (still in development). Members have one week to place orders.</p>

	<p>Then once a month, member producers bring the orders to central Whangarei (exact location still not decided) where the co-op’s volunteers sort everything into customer orders. The orders then go out to several pick-up sites in towns and rural areas across Northland. The Co-op pays for the deliverer’s petrol.</p>

	<p>We are looking to schedule a public meeting to discuss logistics of collecting, sorting and delivering goods to members.</p>
