		<p>Hi {{name}},</p>

		<p>We're sorry to say that the amount of {{productName}} for sale this month has been decreased by the producer due to an unforseen shortage. There is no longer enough available to fill your order. Because of the reduction, the {{productName}} has been automatically removed from your cart.</p>
		
		<p>When something like this happens, the NNFC has a 'first in, first served' policy, so the remaining {{productName}} will go to the customers who ordered it first.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any questions about the changes to the product, please contact us or the <a href="https://foodcoop.nz/contact/{{producerID}}">producer.</a></p>
		
		<p>We apologise for any inconvenience,<br>
			The NNFC team</p>
