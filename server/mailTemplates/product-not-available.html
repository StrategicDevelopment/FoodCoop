		<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

		<p>I am sorry to have to inform you that the {{productName}} in your cart has been removed by the producer. Unfortunately the producer has changed the quantity of {{productName}} they are selling this month and so they will not be able to meet your order. These changes are automatically synchronized with your cart.</p>
		
		<p>To determine who must miss out on the {{productName}} precedence is given to those who ordered first.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any other questions please email us or the <a href="http://foodcoop.org.nz/contact/{{producerID}}">producer.</a></p>
		
		<p>Thank you for your understanding</p>
