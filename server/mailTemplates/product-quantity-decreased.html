		<p>Hi {{name}},</p>

		<p>We're sorry to say that the amount of {{productName}} for sale this month has been reduced by the producer due to an unforseen shortage. Because of the reduction, the number of {{productName}} in your cart has been decreased to {{amount}}. </p>
		
		<p> When something like this happens, the NNFC has a 'first in, first served' policy, so the remaining available {{productName}} will go to the customers who ordered it first.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any questions about the reduction, please contact us or the <a href="https://foodcoop.nz/contact/{{producerID}}">producer.</a></p>
		
		<p>Thank you for your understanding<br>
			The NNFC team</p>
