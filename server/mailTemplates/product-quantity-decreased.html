		<p>Dear {{name}},</p>

		<p>I am sorry to have to inform you that the amount of {{productName}} in your cart has been decreased to {{amount}} because of an unforseen shortage of available {{productName}} by the producer. </p>
		
		<p>To determine who is to have the quantity in their cart dropped, the NNFC gives precedence to those who ordered first.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any other questions please email us or the <a href="http://foodcoop.org.nz/contact/{{producerID}}">producer.</a></p>
		
		<p>Thank you for your understanding</p>
